## What are tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system ‚Äî specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
